# Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE)

_Read the [CASE Wiki tab](https://github.com/casework/CASE/wiki) to learn **everything** you need to know about the Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE) ontology._
_For learning about the Unified Cyber Ontology, CASE's parent, see [UCO](https://github.com/ucoProject/UCO)._

# CASE-Mappings

Current partial mappings (eventually these will be split into fully-completed and partially-completed):
- BulkExtractor
- Cellebrite
- NSRL
- Sleuthkit

# I have a question!

Before you post a Github issue or send an email ensure you've done this checklist:

1. [Determined scope](https://caseontology.org/ontology/start.html#scope) of your task. It is not necessary for most parties to understand all aspects of the ontology, mapping methods, and supporting tools.

2. Familiarize yourself with the [labels](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Mappings/labels) and search the [Issues tab](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Mappings/issues). Typically, only light-blue and red labels should be used by non-admin Github users while the others should be used by CASE Github admins.
*All but the red `Project` labels are found in every [`casework`](https://github.com/casework) repository.*
